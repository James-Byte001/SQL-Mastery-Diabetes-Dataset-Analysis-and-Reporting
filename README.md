# SQL-Mastery-Diabetes-Dataset-Analysis-and-Reporting
This project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques to explore and analyze the Diabetes Dataset. It involves data cleaning, aggregation, and exploration to uncover insights into diabetes diagnosis and related health factors. The project showcases SQL expertise in data validation, analysis, and optimized reporting.

## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: For querying, data cleaning, and analysis.
- **MySQL** (or your chosen database): For storing and managing the dataset.
- **Markdown**: For project documentation and reporting.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Exploration**: Use SQL queries to explore the Diabetes Dataset and understand key trends and patterns.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing or inconsistent data through SQL techniques to ensure dataset integrity.
- **Aggregated Analysis**: Apply aggregation functions to uncover insights, such as average glucose levels by age group or BMI categories.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques**: Use advanced SQL features such as joins, subqueries, and window functions to extract deeper insights from the dataset.
- **Reporting**: Generate and optimize SQL queries to produce actionable reports on diabetes diagnosis and contributing factors.
